## Overview
This repository provides a Python library for kernel density estimation. In
comparison to other Python implementations of kernel density estimation, key
features of this library include:

1. Support for weighted samples
2. A strictly positive kernel for estimation of probability density functions with support on subsets of R+
3. Interface for kernel density estimation from WESTPA data sets (https://westpa.github.io/westpa/).
